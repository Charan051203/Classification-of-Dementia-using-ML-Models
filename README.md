Classification of Dementia Using Various ML Models with LIME and SHAP Interpretation

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on the classification of dementia using multiple Machine Learning (ML) models. The project explores various classification algorithms to predict dementia and further interprets the model predictions using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).

  Key Features:
1. Dataset Preparation: Steps for data preprocessing, feature selection, and splitting the dataset.
2. Model Development: Implementation of various ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and more.
3. Model Evaluation: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.
4. Interpretability: Use of LIME and SHAP to explain individual predictions, providing insights into the decision-making process of the models.
5. Results Analysis: Comparative analysis of model performance and interpretation results to identify the most effective model for dementia classification.

 How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Follow the provided Python script to replicate the study or apply the methods to the dataset available.
